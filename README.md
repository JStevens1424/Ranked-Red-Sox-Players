# About
This is a list ranking all the Red Sox players that finished the season with the team. I will seperate them into 2 main categories, **Starting Pitcher**,  and **Position Player**. I am not doing relief pitchers because of my time constaints. I will use several different statistics in order to judge them. To save time i will only rank the people who played at least half the season (81 games) on the team.

> Here's the thing about Red Sox fans, or actually just fans from that region, in general: they appreciate the effort. And if you mail it in or if you give 80 percent, even with a win, they'll let you know that's not how you do it. They want - if it's comedian, if it's a musician, bring us your best show.
