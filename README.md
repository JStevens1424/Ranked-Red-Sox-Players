# About
This is a list ranking all the Red Sox players that finished the season with the team. I will seperate them into 3 main categories, Starting Pitcher, Relief Pitcher, and Position Player. I will use several different statistics in order to judge them. To save time i will only rank the people who played at least half the season (81 games) on the team.
